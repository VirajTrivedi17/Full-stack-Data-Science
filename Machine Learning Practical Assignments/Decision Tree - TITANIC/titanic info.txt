<h2 align='center'>Features</h2>
    <b>1. Survived</b>
    The first feature reported if a traveler lived or died. A comparison revealed that more than 60% of the passengers 
    had died.
    
    <b>2. Pclass</b>
    This feature renders the passenger division. The tourists could opt from three distinct sections, namely class-1,
    class-2, class-3. The third class had the highest number of commuters, followed by class-2 and class-1. The number 
    of tourists in the third class was more than the number of passengers in the first and second class combined. The 
    survival chances of a class-1 traveler were higher than a class-2 and class-3 traveler.

    <b>3. Sex</b>
    Approximately 65% of the tourists were male while the remaining 35% were female. Nonetheless, the percentage of 
    female survivors was higher than the number of male survivors. More than 80% of male commuters died, as compared to 
    around 70% female commuters.
    
    <b>4. Age</b>
    The youngest traveler onboard was aged around two months and the oldest traveler was 80 years. The average age of 
    tourists onboard was just under 30 years. Clearly, a larger fraction of children under 10 survived than died or 
    every other age group, the number of casualties was higher than the number of survivors. More than 140 people 
    within the age group 20 and 30 were dead as compared to just around 80 people of the same age range sustained.

    <b>5. SibSp</b>
    SibSp is the number of siblings or spouse of a person onboard. A maximum of 8 siblings and spouses traveled along 
    with one of the traveler. More than 90% of people traveled alone or with one of their sibling or spouse. The 
    chances of survival dropped drastically if someone traveled with more than 2 siblings or spouse.
    
    <b>6. Parch</b>
    Similar to the SibSp, this feature contained the number of parents or children each passenger was touring with. 
    A maximum of 9 parents/children traveled along with one of the traveler.
    
    <b>7. Fare</b>
    By splitting the fare amount into four categories, it was obvious that there was a strong association between 
    the charge and the survival. The higher a tourist paid, the higher would be his chances to survive.
    
    <b>8. Embarked</b>
    Embarked implies where the traveler mounted from. There are three possible values for Embark â€” Southampton, 
    Cherbourg, and Queenstown. More than 70% of the people boarded from Southampton. Just under 20% boarded from 
    Cherbourg and the rest boarded from Queenstown. People who boarded from Cherbourg had a higher chance of 
    survival than people who boarded from Southampton or Queenstown.
